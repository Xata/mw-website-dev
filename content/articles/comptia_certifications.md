## PenTest+ and CYSA+
(⌐■_■)                                                                          

I'm pleased to announce that I have earned two more certifications:
[CompTIA PenTest+](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/e17b96f6-d8e1-4bbc-a72b-0accb7a39709)
[CompTIA CYSA+](https://www.credly.com/badges/91a25c38-06a6-4029-bad8-74009e5bec6a)

 Teaching incident response to students prepared me for these certs. Over the last year I've had the pleasure
 to work at MSU Denver teaching students Cybersecurity. I know that the material we're teaching is on the right
 track if it prepared me for these two certs!

 I highly recommend these certifications to students looking at validating their Cybersecurity skills or for an
 IT professional who wants to test there Cybersecurity knowledge.

 ## Next Steps

 I believe that these will be the last certifications for awhile. I've been migrating our Centurion Secured
 platform to be more GitOps oriented. We'll be getting student developers working on the platform soon and
 I'm trying to get it ready for students at MSU Denver to contribute to the project.
