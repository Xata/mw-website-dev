# Updated for Python 3.13.3

During a training session, a student had asked about this project. Unfortunately, during the live demo, I was unable to get this working right off the bat. Whoops.

I've updated the requirements.txt to bump the versions of some modules. Neat.

Now the Python OpenGL demo works with the latest version of Python.
