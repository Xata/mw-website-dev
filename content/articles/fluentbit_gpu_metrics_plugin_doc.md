# Fluent Bit's GPU metrics plugin

I've been contributing to documentation on open source projects for a few years now but it never felt substantial. Finally, I ended up looking into the Fluent-Bit codebase and writing a docs page on a feature that hasn't been documented. I ended up writing the docs page for the GPU metrics plugin. I'm really proud of it so far. Can't wait to continue contributing to open source documentation and software. 

You can check out the page here: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/data-pipeline/inputs/gpu-metrics
