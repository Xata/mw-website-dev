## About me
As of March 2024, I am an IT professional that is transitioning towards a more development-oriented role. My journey into programming began during high school, where I had the privilege of enrolling in college-level courses at my local institution while still in 10th grade. It was there that I encountered a professor whose mentorship deepened my passion for programming and the outdoors. Although circumstances led me to initially pursue a career in IT support, I have remained committed to becoming a proficient programmer. In 2023, I started to redouble my efforts to establish myself as a professional software developer.
