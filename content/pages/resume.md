## Profile

Platform Engineer with 10 years in IT, transitioning from support roles to infrastructure engineering in 2023. Started with 3D graphics programming and brought that problem-solving approach to building production systems. I deploy Kubernetes clusters, design VPC networks, automate infrastructure with Terraform, and build SIEM platforms serving organizations across Colorado. Open source contributor (OpenRCT2, FluentBit) who still builds voxel engines with OpenGL in my spare time. I train university students in cyber range operations and teach them how to translate security operations into business language.
