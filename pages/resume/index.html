<p>Hello! What are you doing here? ლ( ͠°ᗝ °ლ)</p>
<p>I'm the Cybersecurity Platform Architect at the Cybersecurity Center at MSU Denver. I work on building infrastructure that helps students get hands-on experience in cybersecurity while supporting the security of small communities across Colorado. I also teach cloud workshops to get students ready for real-world enterprise environments (╭☞■ᗜ■)╭☞</p>
<p>I led the deployment of CENTURION Secured, a full-scale SOC, in just 66 days. I also run workshops on Kubernetes and other DevOps tools to help students learn real-world tech skills and to introduce them to Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects. Before this, I worked at Dynatrace, focusing on answering chat support tickets around app performance and cloud technologies.</p>
<p>Some people call me a generalist but that's okay with me. I like being able to stand up the infrastructure needed for an organization to succeed. Sprinkle in some custom apps and boom! I've been working with students to push for more local-focused development. Let's build stuff to impact our local communities. </p>
<p>I just like building cool stuff for people who need it.</p>
