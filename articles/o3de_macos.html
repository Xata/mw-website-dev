<p>I decided to document my journey on getting O3DE running on macOS, just in-case someone might find it useful. I wouldn't use this for project just based on how unsupported the game engine is running on macOS. Below you'll find the steps that I took.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I'm looking around for a game engine for macOS. There aren't very many options as of 2024. Especially on Apple Silicon. 
The two biggest game engines on the scene are Unity and Unreal. However, I have a problem with Unity because ever since the
company had gone public the company had made some interesting choices:
https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development</p>
<p>Recently, I found out that Epic Games has pulled the Unreal Tournament series of games from almost every distribution platform. I just 
want to find an alternative to Unreal Engine for now. </p>
<p>All of this led me to find O3DE: https://o3de.org/</p>
<p>An open source, real-time 3D engine sponsored by the Linux Foundation. How cool is that? The only problem is:
THEY DON'T SUPPORT APPLE SILICON OR MACOS OFFICIALLY. Even worse, its not even on the roadmap. 
Although reading throught the GitHub, it appears as though some users have been able to run a specific version of O3DE on their Macs: https://github.com/o3de/o3de/discussions/11357#discussioncomment-4623529</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>You will need to have Homebrew installed and Git installed on your make. You can install Homebrew by going to: https://brew.sh/</p>
<p>You will also need to have Xcode installed, be sure to grab that off the App Store on your Mac.</p>
<p>Once you have brew installed, we need to get the following:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">brew install cmake
brew install git
</code></pre>

<p>Once those are installed we need to also install Git LFS:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
sudo git lfs install --system
</code></pre>

<p>Great! You need to get the macOS equivalent of build-essentials by running:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>We also will need Rosetta 2 installed if you're using a Mac with Apple Silicon:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta
</code></pre>

<h2>Cloning the repo</h2>
<p>We need to clone a specific version of O3DE to get it to work on macOS. I had issues with just cloning the most up to date repo.
These are the steps I did:
Clone the initial repository:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">git clone https://github.com/o3de/o3de.git
</code></pre>

<p>Move into the directory:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">cd o3de
</code></pre>

<p>Now revert to a specific version:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">git reset 4ac8adf --hard
</code></pre>

<p>⚠️ If you try to use the latest version, you'll end up with this error:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">CMake Error at Code/LauncherUnified/Platform/Mac/launcher_project_mac.cmake:26 (message):
  Missing 'Resources' folder.  Candidate paths tried were:
  /Resources/Platform/Mac /Gem/Resources/Platform/Mac
  /Gem/Resources/MacLauncher
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/LYWrappers.cmake:652 (include)
  cmake/LYWrappers.cmake:316 (ly_configure_target_platform_properties)
  Code/LauncherUnified/launcher_generator.cmake:164 (ly_add_target)
  Code/LauncherUnified/CMakeLists.txt:105 (include)
</code></pre>

<p>This will take some investigating later on down the road. For now, I just want to see if I can get O3DE running on my MacBook.</p>
<h2>Building the project</h2>
<p>Once you've reverted the project to the specific version. We can now build the project:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh"># Configure the editor's build
cmake -B ./build/mac_xcode -S . -G Xcode -DLY_ASSET_DEPLOY_MODE=LOOSE -DLY_ASSET_DEPLOY_ASSET_TYPE=mac
# Build the editor
cmake --build build/mac_xcode --target Editor  --config profile
# Run the editor
./build/mac_xcode/bin/profile/Editor.app/Contents/MacOS/Editor
</code></pre>

<p>These steps are taken from this GitHub comment: https://github.com/o3de/o3de/discussions/11357#discussioncomment-4623529</p>
<h3>Configure the editor's build</h3>
<p>When you run cmake to configure the editor's build, you might see an error like this:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">---
CMake Error at cmake/3rdPartyPackages.cmake:287 (message):
  ly_package: - Unable to get package googlebenchmark-1.5.0-rev2-mac from any
  download server.  Enable LY_PACKAGE_DEBUG to debug.

  Error from server https://d3t6xeg4fgfoum.cloudfront.net - 35 - &quot;SSL connect
  error&quot;
---
</code></pre>

<p>I found that just running the command again will pull the package for you.
The packages that gave me trouble were (this list was almost a mirror image of the requirements.txt file...):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">googlebenchmark-1.5.0-rev2-mac
lz4-1.9.3-vcpkg-rev4-mac
expat-2.4.2-rev2-mac
md5-2.0-multiplatform
tiff-4.2.0.15-rev3-mac
squish-ccr-deb557d-rev1-mac
assimp-5.1.6-rev2-mac
xxhash-0.7.4-rev1-multiplatform
AWSNativeSDK-1.9.50-rev1-mac
pybind11-2.10.0-rev1-multiplatform
mcpp-2.7.2_az.2-rev1-mac
DirectXShaderCompilerDxc-1.6.2112-o3de-rev1-mac
SPIRVCross-2021.04.29-rev1-mac
azslc-1.8.9-rev1-mac
astc-encoder-3.2-rev5-mac
ISPCTexComp-36b80aa-rev1-mac
OpenEXR-3.1.3-rev4-mac
openimageio-opencolorio-2.3.17-rev3-mac
png-1.6.37-rev2-mac
freetype-2.11.1-rev1-mac
PhysX-4.1.2.29882248-rev5-mac
poly2tri-7f0487a-rev1-mac
v-hacd-2.3-1a49edf-rev1-mac
libsamplerate-0.2.1-rev2-mac
mikkelsen-1.0.0.4-mac
</code></pre>

<p>Even after all of the rerunning of the command. I ran into this error:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/Users/squishy/Developer/o3de/cmake/AzAutoGen.py&quot;, line 412, in &lt;module&gt;
    import jinja2
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jinja2'
</code></pre>

<p>Look like jinja2 is missing. I fixed this by going to where Python was packaged with the source:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">cd o3de/python/
</code></pre>

<p>Then I ran the pip.sh in there:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">./pip.sh install jinja2
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I ran cmake AGAIN:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">cmake -B ./build/mac_xcode -S . -G Xcode -DLY_ASSET_DEPLOY_MODE=LOOSE -DLY_ASSET_DEPLOY_ASSET_TYPE=mac
</code></pre>

<p>And after a harrowing 30 seconds, I was greated with:
<img alt="CMAKE Success" src="../img/o3de_cmake_terminal.png" /></p>
<p>Hooray! (◕‿◕✿)
We did it. Finally.</p>
<h3>Build the editor</h3>
<p>Okay now we can run:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">cmake --build build/mac_xcode --target Editor  --config profile
</code></pre>

<p>After the journey that was running cmake configure. I was expecting some errors but after 7 minutes I was greeted with:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
</code></pre>

<p>YESSSS!!! I was so excited to see that pop-up on the terminal window. </p>
<h3>Run the editor</h3>
<p>To run the editor we need to enter:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-zsh">./build/mac_xcode/bin/profile/Editor.app/Contents/MacOS/Editor
</code></pre>

<p>It works:
<img alt="O3DE Project Manager Working" src="../img/o3de_project_manager_success.png" /></p>
<h2>Testing O3DE</h2>
<p>There is a project called Automated Testing. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see if it works so I hit the build project button. The build does end up having one failure but you're still able to open the editor:
<img alt="O3DE Editor Waiting" src="../img/o3de_editor.png" /></p>
<p>We wait. It took about 5ish minutes to finally get into the editor:
<img alt="O3DE Editor Working" src="../img/o3de_editor_working.png" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a really hectic process to get O3DE working on macOS. I have a feeling that Rosetta 2 is doing a lot of the heavy lifting with this app. I look forward to playing with O3DE more, however, it'll probably end up being on my desktop machine. Thank you for reading this and I hope you found the information useful and interesting. </p>
