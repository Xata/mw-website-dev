<p>A little late to putting this up on my website but on December 20, 2024, I earned my <strong>Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional (GICSP)</strong> certification. This one means a lot to me because it’s all about protecting industrial systems and bridging the gap between IT and operational technology.</p>
<p>I really want to thank my current place of employment, The Cybersecurity Center at MSU Denver, for making this certification happen.</p>
<p>The exam wasn’t easy, it definitely made me think. My experience with things like system hardening and network security came in handy. It felt good to connect the dots between what I’ve done in the field and what the certification covers. </p>
<p>If you want to check it out, here’s my badge on Credly: <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/5b7a467f-78d9-4113-b2d8-ef1554016ff9">GICSP Badge</a>.  </p>
<p>This was a big step for me, and I’m excited to keep going. Time to figure out what’s next!</p>
